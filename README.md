#### 1000 App Pledge

The 1000 App Pledge is a challenge I have set out for me to create 1000 apps. I'm doing this to help build my portfolio and improve my development skills. The apps I will develop will range from very simple to very complex and useful.

This the 4th app I developed under this pledge.

# Bill Split
It is a smart bill splitting app which removes all the hassles of splitting a bill. It splits the bill fairly and not just divide a number with another number.

**Minimum SDK Version:** 19

**Clone and import in Android Studio to mess around.**

#### Features
1. Set your default Currency
2. Set default tax rate
3. Set default tip rate
4. Split bill equally or unequally.
